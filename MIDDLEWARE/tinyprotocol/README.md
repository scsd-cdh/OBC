# Introduction
The goal for this protocol is to offer a simple standard for communication between a main board and its peripheral boards. It is meant to be built on top of existing wired communication protocols like I2C, UART, and so on. It does not provide any form of packet segmentation as it is meant to be extremely straight forward.

In the protocol, messages are called commands, and they are split into two categories: telecommands, and telemetry requests.
